The following data preprocessing steps are **widely adopted practices** in sequential recommendation, especially when handling implicit feedback or highly sparse data. The method have been integrated into mainstream open-source recommendation frameworks such as [SSLRec](https://github.com/HKUDS/SSLRec).

To ensure full transparency and reproducibility:
- We have publicly released the [complete preprocessing code](dataset/pre_process.ipynb) (using ML-20M as an example)
- All preprocessed datasets are available at [dataset](dataset)

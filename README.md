# CTF4Rec
Sequential recommendation aims to predict users’ preferences based on their previous interaction. Recently, multi-spatial collaborative modelling that incorporates temporal and frequency domains has emerged as an important research direction for improving recommendation performance. However, accurately capturing the holistic evolutionary characteristics and potential periodicity of user behaviour remains a significant challenge. This study proposes a self-supervised cross-view enhanced time-frequency hybrid sequential recommendation net
work (CTF4Rec) that leverages a tri-dimensional collaborative modelling approach incorporating graph structural view, frequency domain, and time domain. In the view dimension, CTF4Rec constructs a user interest-transition graph and an item co-interaction graph to capture user interest shift patterns and intentional tendencies. Within the frequency domain, CTF4Rec uses an innovative frequency ramp structure combined with auto-correlation attention mechanisms to capture periodic behaviour patterns. In the temporal domain, CTF4Rec uses the Gaus
sian distribution space to characterise the evolutionary patterns of user behaviour. Furthermore, CTF4Rec uses a multi-task learning framework that includes cross-view contrastive loss and sequential contrastive loss to guide the optimisation process. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that CTF4Rec outperformed state-of-the-art baseline models and exhibited superior robustness in cold-start, item sparsity, and noise interference.
